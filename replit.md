# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The website is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no frameworks or build tools. Key architectural decisions include:

- **Static Multi-Page Structure**: Each service has its own dedicated HTML page (wuerfelshop.html, sticker.html, partnerevent.html, etc.) for clear content organization
- **Component-Based Partials**: Header and footer are separated into reusable partial files loaded via JavaScript for consistency across pages
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: CSS uses modern techniques like CSS Grid and Flexbox with media queries for responsive behavior
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, with JavaScript enhancing user experience

## Backend Architecture (Added August 2025)
The project includes a simple Express.js server for serving static files:

- **Express Server**: Node.js server (server.js) serving static website files
- **Static File Serving**: All HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets served via Express middleware

## Styling System
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Consistent color palette and spacing using CSS variables (--primary: #0A3A68, --accent: #FF4C00, --cyan: #00CFFF)
- **Typography**: Google Fonts integration with Nunito Sans for body text and Baloo 2 for headings
- **Component-Based CSS**: Styles organized with BEM-like naming conventions for maintainability

## Content Management
- **German Language Focus**: All content is in German targeting German-speaking Monopoly GO players
- **Service-Oriented Pages**: Each page follows a consistent structure with hero section, navigation, product overview, pricing, and FAQ sections
- **Legal Compliance**: Dedicated pages for GDPR compliance (datenschutz.html), terms of service (agb.html), and other legal requirements

## Navigation Structure
- **Sticky Navigation**: Product pages include sticky navigation for easy section jumping
- **Mobile Drawer Menu**: JavaScript-powered mobile menu with clean animations
- **Comprehensive Sitemap**: Dedicated sitemap page for SEO and user navigation
