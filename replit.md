# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The website is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no frameworks or build tools. Key architectural decisions include:

- **Organized Directory Structure**: Pages organized into logical directories:
  - `/shop/`: E-commerce pages (wuerfelshop.html, sticker.html, accounts.html, bestellformular.html)
  - `/service/`: Service pages (partnerevent.html, kontakt-support.html)
  - `/hilfe/`: Help and support pages (index.html, faq.html, loginmoeglichkeiten.html)
  - `/recht/`: Legal pages (impressum.html, datenschutz.html, agb.html, widerruf.html)
- **Component-Based Partials**: Header and footer are separated into reusable partial files loaded via JavaScript for consistency across pages
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: CSS uses modern techniques like CSS Grid and Flexbox with media queries for responsive behavior
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, with JavaScript enhancing user experience

## Backend Architecture (Added August 2025)
The project includes a simple Express.js server for serving static files:

- **Express Server**: Node.js server (server.js) serving static website files
- **Static File Serving**: All HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets served via Express middleware

## Styling System
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Consistent color palette and spacing using CSS variables (--primary: #0A3A68, --accent: #FF4C00, --cyan: #00CFFF)
- **Typography**: Google Fonts integration with Nunito Sans for body text and Baloo 2 for headings
- **Component-Based CSS**: Styles organized with BEM-like naming conventions for maintainability

## Content Management
- **German Language Focus**: All content is in German targeting German-speaking Monopoly GO players
- **Service-Oriented Pages**: Each page follows a consistent structure with hero section, navigation, product overview, pricing, and FAQ sections
